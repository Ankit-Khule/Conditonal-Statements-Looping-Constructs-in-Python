# Conditonal-Statements & Looping Constructs-in-Python
* In python there are no brackets present for writing loops or conditional statment, instead we use indentation to represent the part inside a condition or loop.
* It will throw an error if proper indentation is not present. or if multiple loops are there withou proper indentation a function can be outside the loop.

* Python consist of control statements
  * continue - this will return the control to the beginning of the loop
  * break - this will break the loop and brings control out of the loop.
  * pass - it will let the loop continue and do nothing. used mostly in exception handling or running some empty loop.
  
## Below are the most used condtional statements and looping contructs:
