# Conditonal-Statements & Looping Constructs-in-Python
* In python there are no brackets present for writing loops or conditional statment, instead we use indentation to represent the part inside a condition or loop.
* It will throw an error if proper indentation is not present. or if multiple loops are there withou proper indentation a function can be outside the loop.

* Python consist of control statements
  * continue - this will return the control to the beginning of the loop
  * break - this will break the loop and brings control out of the loop.
  * pass - it will let the loop continue and do nothing. used mostly in exception handling or running some empty loop.
  
## Below are the most used condtional statements and looping contructs:

## [if-Else](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/if-else.ipynb)

* If Else:

* if -elif- else

## [While-loop](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/while-loop.ipynb)
* While loop

* Nested while loop

* control statements used in while loop
 * pass 
 ![pass](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/images/pass.JPG)
 * break
  ![break](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/images/break.JPG)
 * continue 
 ![continue](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/images/Continue.JPG)
 
 
## [For Loop](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/for-loop.ipynb)
* For loop
 ![For](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/images/for.JPG)
 
* Nested for Loop
 ![NestedFor](https://github.com/Ankit-Khule/Conditonal-Statements-Looping-Constructs-in-Python/blob/master/images/nestedfor.JPG)
 
* range function in for loop
